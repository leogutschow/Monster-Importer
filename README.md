Main purpose
-
Monster Importer is a Web App where you can import your desired Monster 
from any RPG game to Roll20 without having to write every single aspect of it.
It makes it faster to plan your campaign inside Roll20, giving you more time
to plan adventures instead of copy/past stats of every Kobold you want your
players to kill

Features
-
In the current state, Monster Import have the following features:

- See and Import Monsters from the Site to Roll20
- Create your own Home Brew Monster for other to spicy their games
- Games with full SRD Monsters:
  -- DND 5e

What's missing?
-
I have big plans for Monster Importer, such as:

- Having Monsters from every game, at least the most famous ones
- People could create and Import their own Characters Sheets to their games
- A Forum so people can discuss their Monsters and their games
- Populate the Web App with Monster left, at least from the most popular games

How to use?
-
1. Use the Mod feature with the script in the 'mod/monster-importer.js'
2. When you find your dream monster, just click in the 'Import Monster' button. You will receive a link to put in the Roll20 chat in your campaign
3. That's it! Now you can import any Monster to your game!
